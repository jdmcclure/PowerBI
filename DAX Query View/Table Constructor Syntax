The DAX language has a table constructor syntax to create an unnamed table in a DAX expression. 
This syntax is helpful when you need a temporary table with a small number of rows in a DAX 
expression or when you want to create a calculated table with constant and calculated values.

The more common use case for a table constructor is with the IN operator:
*/
EVALUATE
CALCULATETABLE (
    'Product',
    'Product'[Color] IN { "Red", "Blue", "White" }
)



/*
The previous example uses a table constructor that returns one column and three rows. 
However, the table constructor can have two or more columns for each row, as in the following example:
*/
EVALUATE
CALCULATETABLE (
    'Product',
    ( 'Product'[Color], 'Product'[Brand] )
        IN { ( "Red", "Contoso" ), ( "Blue", "Litware" ) }
)



/*
Suppose you need a small table with constant values. 
In that case, the calculated table with the table constructor is an alternative to the “Enter data” 
feature in Power BI, which generates a Power Query script with constant values:
*/
Price Range =
SELECTCOLUMNS (
    {
        ( 1, "LOW", 0, 100 ),
        ( 2, "MEDIUM", 100, 500 ),
        ( 3, "HIGH", 500, 9999999 )
    },
    "PriceRangeKey", [Value1],
    "Price Range", [Value2],
    "Min", [Value3],
    "Max", [Value4]
)
