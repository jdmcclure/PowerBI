/*
Location: COMBINED_TRAINING table   
This calculated column, CC_TRAINING_REQUIRED, determines whether a specific training is 
required for a given individual based on their NET_ID and training REQ_ID. 

It performs the following steps:

    1. Retrieves the NET_ID and REQ_ID from the COMBINED_TRAINING table.
    2. Uses the NET_ID to look up training requirement flags from the MIDP_DIRECTORY table:
        - RCR_ONLINE_REQUIRED
        - RCR_F2F_REQUIRED
        - COI_REQUIRED
        - RST_REQUIRED
    3. Based on the REQ_ID value:
        - "2" corresponds to RCR Online training
        - "1" corresponds to RCR Face-to-Face training
        - "10" corresponds to COI training
        - "16" corresponds to RST training
    4. For each REQ_ID, if the corresponding requirement flag is "True", the individual is 
    marked as "Required", otherwise they are marked as "Not Required".
    5. If none of the expected REQ_ID values match, the result is BLANK.

This logic allows the report to show whether an individual is required to take a specific type 
of training based on institutional compliance rules stored in the MIDP_DIRECTORY (calculated
in the dataflow).
