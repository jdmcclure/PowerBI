/*
Location: MIDP_DIRECTORY_G table
Explanation:
CC_DEPARTMENT_NAME is a calculated column that assigns the department name associated with each individual in the directory. 
It works by:
    - Looking up the value of UNIT_NAME from the 'unit' table,
    - Matching the UNIT NUMBER in that table to the DEPARTMENT_COMBINED field in 'MIDP_DIRECTORY_G'.
In essence, it's pulling the official department name for each person based on their combined department ID.

CC_DEPARTMENT_NAME =

    'unit'[UNIT_NAME],
    'unit'[UNIT NUMBER], 
    'MIDP_DIRECTORY_G'[DEPARTMENT_COMBINED]
