/*
Location: MIDP_DIRECTORY_G table
Explanation:
COI_email_flag_not_started is a calculated column that sets an email notification flag for individuals who haven’t yet 
begun their required COI disclosure process. 
It functions as follows:
- Retrieves the individual’s CSU ID and whether they are required to submit a COI disclosure.
- Looks up their latest disclosure approval status based on the CSU ID.
- If:
    - COI disclosure is required,
    - Their latest status is “Not Started”, and
    - Their department is not “0001” or “0004”
    → Then the flag is set to TRUE (indicating they should be emailed).
    - Otherwise, it returns FALSE.
