/*
Location: MIDP_DIRECTORY_G table
Explanation:
This measure determines whether an individual is "Compliant" or "Not Compliant" 
based on their Conflict of Interest (COI) disclosure status.

Logic:
1. Retrieves the individual's CSU_ID and whether they are required to submit a COI disclosure.
2. Looks up the most recent expiration date for the individual's COI disclosure using their CSU_ID.
3. If the individual is required to submit a COI disclosure:
   - Returns "Not Compliant" if:
     a. There is no expiration date found, OR
     b. The expiration date is before today's date.
   - Returns "Compliant" if the expiration date is today or in the future.
4. If COI is not required, the measure returns a blank.

Used to evaluate and label individuals based on their current COI compliance status.
