/*
Location: MIDP_DIRECTORY_G table
Explanation:
CC_email_flag_expired is a calculated column that determines whether a notification flag should be set for individuals 
with problematic COI disclosure statuses. Specifically, it:
    - Pulls the individual’s CSU ID and whether a COI disclosure is required.
    - Checks the most recent disclosure record for that individual where:
        - The action is marked as the most recent,
        - The disclosure status is either "Expired" or "In Progress".
        - If a disclosure is required, 
            and the person has at least one expired or in-progress most recent disclosure, 
            and they are not part of departments “0001” or “0004”,
        → Then the flag is set to TRUE (indicating they should be emailed).
    - Otherwise, the flag returns FALSE
