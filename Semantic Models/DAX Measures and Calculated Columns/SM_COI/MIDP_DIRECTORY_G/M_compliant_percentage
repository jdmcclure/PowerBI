/*
Location: MIDP_DIRECTORY_G table
Explanation:

This measure calculates the percentage of individuals who are "Compliant" 
out of the total number of individuals who are required to complete a 
Conflict of Interest (COI) disclosure.

Logic:
1. Counts the number of individuals where COI_REQUIRED is TRUE â€” these are 
   the people expected to be compliant.
2. Counts the number of individuals where CC_compliance = "Compliant".
3. If there are no compliant individuals, returns a placeholder string "--".
4. Otherwise, divides the number of compliant individuals by the number 
   of required individuals to return a decimal value (as a percentage).

Note: This measure returns a blank if the denominator (_required) is zero, 
ensuring it avoids divide-by-zero errors.
