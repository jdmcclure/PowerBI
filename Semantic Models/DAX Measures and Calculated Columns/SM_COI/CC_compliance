/*
Location: MIDP_DIRECTORY_G table
Explanation: 
CC_compliance is a calculated column that determines whether an individual is compliant with Conflict of Interest (COI) disclosure requirements. 
It performs the following checks:
- Retrieves the individual's CSU ID and whether a COI disclosure is required.
- Finds the individual's most relevant action type and disclosure expiration date from the disclosures table, using the CSU ID as a match key.
- If the individual is required to submit a COI disclosure, it checks:
    - If there’s no expiration date, or
    - If the expiration date is before today
    → Then, the individual is marked as "Not Compliant".
    - Otherwise, the individual is marked as "Compliant".
If COI disclosure is not required, no compliance status is returned.
