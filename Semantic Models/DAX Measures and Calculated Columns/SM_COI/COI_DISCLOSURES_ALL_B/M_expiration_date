/*
Location: COI_DISCLOSURES_ALL_B table
Explanation: 

This measure calculates the expiration date of an individual's most recent 
Conflict of Interest (COI) disclosure.

Logic:
1. Retrieves the individual's CSU_ID from the MIDP_DIRECTORY_G table.
2. Finds the most recent COI disclosure submission date (UPDATED field) 
   from the COI_DISCLOSURES_ALL_B table, filtered to:
   - Only include rows where MOST_RECENT_SUBMIT_ACTION = TRUE()
   - SCHOOL_ID matches the individual's CSU_ID
3. If a disclosure date is found, adds 365 days to it to determine the expiration date.
4. Returns:
   - The calculated expiration date if available
   - BLANK() if no disclosure was submitted

This measure provides a standardized 1-year expiration window for each individual's 
latest COI disclosure, used in compliance tracking.
