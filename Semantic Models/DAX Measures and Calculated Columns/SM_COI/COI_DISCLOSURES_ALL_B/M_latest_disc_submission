/*
Location: COI_DISCLOSURES_ALL_B table
Explanation: 

This measure returns the submission date of an individual's most recent 
Conflict of Interest (COI) disclosure, formatted as "mm/dd/yyyy".

Logic:
1. Retrieves the individual's CSU_ID from the MIDP_DIRECTORY_G table.
2. Searches the COI_DISCLOSURES_ALL_B table for the most recent disclosure record where:
   - MOST_RECENT_SUBMIT_ACTION = TRUE()
   - SCHOOL_ID matches the individual's CSU_ID
3. Retrieves the UPDATED timestamp from the matching record.
4. Returns:
   - The submission date formatted as "mm/dd/yyyy" if found
   - BLANK() if no disclosure has been submitted

This measure is used to display the date of the most recent COI disclosure submission 
for compliance tracking and audit purposes.
