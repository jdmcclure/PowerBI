/*
Location: COI_DISCLOSURES_ALL_B table
Explanation: 

This measure returns the creation date and time of an individual's most recent 
Conflict of Interest (COI) disclosure submission, formatted for display.

Logic:
1. Retrieves the individual's CSU_ID from the MIDP_DIRECTORY_G table.
2. Searches the COI_DISCLOSURES_ALL_B table for the most recent submission where:
   - MOST_RECENT_SUBMIT_ACTION = TRUE()
   - SCHOOL_ID matches the individual's CSU_ID
3. Retrieves the CREATED timestamp from the matching disclosure record.
4. Returns:
   - The created date/time in "mm/dd/yyyy HH:mm" format if a record is found
   - "Not Started" if no matching disclosure exists

This measure is useful for identifying when an individual's most recent 
COI disclosure was initiated.
