/*
Location: COI_DISCLOSURES_ALL_B table
Explanation: 

This measure calculates the number of days remaining until a user's Conflict of Interest (COI) disclosure expires,
or indicates their current disclosure status.

Logic:
1. Retrieves the individual's CSU_ID from the MIDP_DIRECTORY_G table.
2. Looks up the most recent COI disclosure submission date (UPDATED field) 
   from the COI_DISCLOSURES_ALL_B table where:
   - MOST_RECENT_SUBMIT_ACTION = TRUE()
   - SCHOOL_ID matches the individual's CSU_ID
3. Calculates an expiration date by adding 365 days to the most recent disclosure date.
4. Calculates the number of days between today and the expiration date.
5. Returns:
   - "Not Started" if the disclosure approval status is "Not Started"
   - "Expired" if the expiration date is in the past (i.e., days < 0)
   - The number of days remaining (formatted with thousands separator) if available
   - BLANK() if no applicable data is found

This measure provides a user-friendly summary of how close a COI disclosure is to expiring,
or if itâ€™s already expired or not yet started.
