/*
Location: COI_DISCLOSURES_ALL_B table
Explanation: 

This measure returns the routing status of an individual's most recent 
Conflict of Interest (COI) disclosure.

Logic:
1. Retrieves the individual's CSU_ID from the MIDP_DIRECTORY_G table.
2. Searches the COI_DISCLOSURES_ALL_B table for the most recent action where:
   - MOST_RECENT_ACTION = TRUE()
   - SCHOOL_ID matches the individual's CSU_ID
3. Retrieves the ROUTING_STATUS from the matching record.
4. Returns:
   - The routing status (e.g., "Pending", "In Review", "Completed") if found
   - BLANK() if no recent disclosure with routing data exists

This measure is used to track the current step or stage in the COI disclosure 
workflow for each individual.
