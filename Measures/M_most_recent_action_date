/*
    This measure is used to find the most recent activity type from the 'negotiation_activity' table.
    It is designed to be used in a report or dashboard where the context of the negotiation ID is important.

    A negotiation can have many activities, and this measure will return the most recent activity type.

    ISINSCOPE limits the measure to return a value only when the negotiation ID is in the current context,
    preventing it from returning a value when the context is at a higher level (such as totals).
